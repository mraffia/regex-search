# Regex Search
This is an implementation of the **Regex Search** practice project from [Chapter 9 â€“ Reading and Writing Files](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter9/) of the book [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) by Al Sweigart.

## Project Description
A program that opens all *.txt* files in the current working directory/folder and searches for any line that matches a user-supplied regular expression. The results will be printed to the screen.
